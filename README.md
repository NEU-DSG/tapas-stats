# tapas-stats
stylesheets, etc., for generating statistics for end users

I'm imagining that either a reading "view" within the readaing interface, or a separate "stats" tab will be used to display rudimentary statistics to the user.
I'd also like to see a bit of prose explaining that these are just rudimentary stats, with a link to some other place (is TAPOR still around?) for real analysis.
